Udacity Self Driving Car Final Project

## Real training data

The provided ROS bags contain two series of images taken from on-board camera:

- `loop_with_traffic_light.bag`: the car drives in circle. At the beginning of each loop there is a traffic light. The traffic light colour changes throughout the dataset. [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/lwdH3HAIAH0)
- `just_traffic_light.bag`: the car moves back and forth in front of the traffic light that changes colour. [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/nAYmVXXsOg8)

Images were extracted with scripts in `traffic_light_bag_files/`.
